            <p>
                My name is Rohit Balaji. I'm a Part II Software Engineering Student studying at the University of Auckland. I have a strong passion for software development, and the ability to develop what starts as a creative vision, into an immersive, and enjoyable experience. I enjoy tackling the development of aspects within the front end, as well as the back end of a program. I also enjoy developing games, since gaming is one of my personal hobbies. I encourage you to connect with me on Linkedin via the connect button in the NavBar.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a background of writing code, and developing projects which tackle issues I've struggled with, as well as projects which develop a product that's enjoyable to a wide audience. I pride myself on having a strong drive, and positive work ethic, as well as excelling when it comes to taking on leadership positions in group projects. Through the various people I've worked with, as well as the languages I've had to adapt to learning throughout High School Computer Science, and University Software Engineering, I've become a person who's able to adapt to my environment, and produce high quality work.

                            A JavaFX desktop application where players test their wits against a learning AI. This initially started as a University Assignment, however, I've developed a functional GUI to be paired with the original Terminal/Commandline version of the game, as well as implementing a new 'Nightmare' difficulty. The installation and setup instructions are included in the README.md file found in the Github Repository linked below. Put your skills to the test against a learning robot.
